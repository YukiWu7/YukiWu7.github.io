Hi! I'm Yuki Wu, a senior student majoring in Computer Science in the department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu) since Fall 2022. I'm also majoring in Electrical and Computer Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) since Fall 2020. I work in [Language and Inormation Technologies (LIT) Lab](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/index.html) where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/) and mentored by [Santiago Castro](https://santi.uy/). My research interest lies in Computer Graphics and Computer Vision. 
My hobbies are dancing, photographing, and watching movies.
